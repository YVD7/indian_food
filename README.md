Problem statement

Food Optimization is one of the primary concerns of the food industry in recent years. The
goal is to avoid problems of under-production as well as over-production that can lead to shortage or
wastage accordingly. The level of the tolerance of the people in such a sensitive matter is very low,
and strict actions are taken to avoid wastage.

Conclusion

Various multidisciplinary systems are governed by AI to assess many metrics depicting
quality, appearance, texture, overall consumer acceptability, and so on. This unique strategy
entailed studying data patterns and adjusting the process to provide output that is correct,
reliable, takes fewer humanoid incomes, is competent, and helps the operator forecast
upcoming circumstances over time
The use of AI and ML in food production and restaurant operations is already putting AI in
charge of food safety. Artificial intelligence has taken the food safety industry to a new level
by reducing human errors in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, unused goods. It
provides lower packing and delivery costs, more customer satisfaction, faster services, voice
searching, and more personalised orders. Large food companies can also profit from these
business advantages, which will provide a clear gain in the long run
